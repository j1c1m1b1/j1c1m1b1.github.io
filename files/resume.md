# About Me
I have worked in Software Development for the past 8 years. I currently work at [HSE 24](http://www.hse24.de/) as an Android Developer. One of my tasks as a member of the app team is to re-implement the company's Android application by proposing and following a standard architecture that can adapt to the Data and Test Driven Development methodology followed by the app team. At the same me and my colleagues have to balance the re-implementation with the creationg of new features and bug-fixing.

I previously worked as an Android developer at [troido](http://www.troido.de/) where I worked for several clients developing and maintaining new and legacy Android applications. Whenever I wasn't working for one of troido's clients I worked in R&D for the company's Bluetooth technology.

My previous job was at [Mercadoni](https://www.mercadoni.com.co/) as a Tech Lead/Android Developer. As an Android Developer I was responsible for the company's order delivery related software, but I also developed some features for the client's application. On the other hand as a Tech Lead I managed a talented and effective team of engineers to update the company to a more software centered approach for logistic processes, such as delivery boys assignation to client's orders and forecasting. In general I upgraded the operation of the startup by making the life of the people that makes deliveries for the company a little bit easier by optimizing logistic processes with software and killing bugs and creating new features for the app.
