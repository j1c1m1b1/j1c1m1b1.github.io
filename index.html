					</div>
					<p>I have worked in Software Development for the past 7 years. I currently work at Globant, until recently I was the backup lead developer of the Shop Disney Parks application project. My roles were to help manage a team of Android developers and make relevant decisions about the project architecture and management. I was involved in developing multiple features, maintenance and bug fixing for multiple versions of the app.</p>
					<p>Previously, I worked as an Android Developer for Prodigious Brand Logistics, in a multidisciplinary support team of engineers, where I had the opportunity to develop custom Android applications for some of the clients of the Publicis Groupe. I also worked as an Android Developer in Imaginamos, where I made valuable applications for multiple national and international clients of the company.</p>
